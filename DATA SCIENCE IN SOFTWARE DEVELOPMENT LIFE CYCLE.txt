DATA SCIENCE IN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE
1) Know the BUSINESS PROBLEM <NEEDS COLLABORATION>
2) Think of Data that will be needed; Make Hypothesis
3) Collect as much data as possible -> for new model <NEEDS COLLABORATION>
4) Know about the existing models (if present) <NEEDS COLLABORATION>
5) Translate Business Problem to Machine Learning problem <NEEDS COLLABORATION>
6) Establish a test / validation framework -> Make Prototype & see if you get SIGNAL
7) Create Models -> Fine Tune -> Find Best Solution
8) Consider Time/Cost efficiency as well as Performance
9) Export model parameter / pipeline settings <NEEDS COLLABORATION>
10) Apply these in one environment <NEEDS COLLABORATION>
11) Quality Test on the model -> Finalize/Deploy <NEEDSCOLLABORATION>
12) Access how well doing with time <NEEDS COLLABORATION>
