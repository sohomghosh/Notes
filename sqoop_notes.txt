--split-by : It is used to specify the column of the table used to generate splits for imports. This means that it specifies which column will be used to create the split while importing the data into your cluster. It can be used to enhance the import performance by achieving greater parallelism. Sqoop creates splits based on values in a particular column of the table which is specified by --split-by by the user through the import command. If it is not available, the primary key of the input table is used to create the splits.
It is used to distribute the values from table across the mappers uniformly i.e. say u have 100 unique records(primary key) and if there are 4 mappers, --split-by (primary key column) will help to distribute you data-set evenly among the mappers.

Reason to use : Sometimes the primary key doesn't have an even distribution of values between the min and max values(which is used to create the splits if --split-by is not available). In such a situation you can specify some other column which has proper distribution of data to create splits for efficient imports.


$CONDITIONS is used by Sqoop process, it will replace with a unique condition expression internally to get the data-set. If you run a parallel import, the map tasks will execute your query with different values substituted in for $CONDITIONS. e.g., one mapper may execute "select bla from foo WHERE (id >=0 AND id < 10000)", and the next mapper may execute "select bla from foo WHERE (id >= 10000 AND id < 20000)" and so on.


#Replace unnecessary characters
replace(replace(replace(replace(<column_name>,chr(13),''),chr(10), ''),',',' '),chr(9),' ')


nohup sqoop import --connect jdbc:<database_type like db2 or mysql >://<ip>:<port>/<database_name>   --username <username>   --password <password>   --query "<query like select * from table name> where \$CONDITIONS with ur" --m 1 --target-dir <path_in_hadoop> &
